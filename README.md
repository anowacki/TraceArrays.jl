Experimental package to trial different approaches to dealing with DAS and
nodal seismic data within [Seis.jl](https://github.com/anowacki/Seis.jl).

Note that this package is not planned to be maintained.  You are welcome to
use the code, but if the contents are thought to be useful, they will be
merged back into Seis.jl and this repo archived or even deleted.
